### Hello, I'm Vitor!

As a good tech enthusiast and a big curious, I always asked my self how things, that I have always been in touch with, did really work. After almost 6 years working as a financial analyst, in january 2021, I finally decided to change my carrer's path and started my web development studies at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).

These are the techonologies and Tools I'm familiarized with:

- GIT
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React JS
- Redux
- Jest
- ESlint
