### Hello, I'm Vitor!

As a good tech enthusiast and a big curious, I always asked my self how things, that I have constantly been in touch with, did really work. With this mindset, after almost 5 years working as a financial analyst for tech companies, in january 2021, I finally decided to change my carrer's path and started my web development studies at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).

If you want to get in touch with me, here is my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitorguima/) profile. I'm optn to work.
